# Strategy Design Pattern

## Introduction

The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently of clients that use it.

The Strategy pattern is particularly useful when different variations of an algorithm are required and when a class needs to be configured with one of multiple behaviors dynamically.

## Benefits of Strategy Design Pattern

- **Encapsulates Algorithms:** Algorithms are encapsulated into separate classes, making them easier to maintain, reuse, and test.
- **Promotes Code Reusability:** By encapsulating algorithms, they can be reused across different contexts without duplication of code.
- **Enhances Flexibility:** Clients can select different algorithms dynamically at runtime, providing flexibility and customization options.
- **Improves Maintainability:** Changes to individual algorithms do not affect the clients using them, promoting code maintainability and scalability.
- **Facilitates Testing:** Each algorithm can be tested independently, simplifying the testing process and improving code reliability.

## Explanation of Example

The provided code scenario demonstrates the Strategy Design Pattern by implementing a simple payment system. Different payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal, Cash) are encapsulated as separate strategies. The ShoppingCart class uses a payment strategy to process payments dynamically at runtime.

### Payment Strategy Interface and Implementations

The `IPaymentStrategy` interface defines the contract for payment strategies, with a method for making payments. Concrete payment strategies (CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, CashPayment) implement this interface, each providing its own payment logic.

### ShoppingCart Class

The ShoppingCart class represents a shopping cart that utilizes a payment strategy to process payments. It contains a reference to an `IPaymentStrategy`, allowing clients to switch payment methods dynamically.

### Client Code

In the Main method of the Program class, different shopping carts are created with various payment strategies. The checkout process demonstrates how different payment methods can be applied to process payments.

## Conclusion

The Strategy Design Pattern provides an elegant solution for managing interchangeable algorithms and promoting code flexibility and maintainability. By encapsulating algorithms into separate classes and allowing them to be selected dynamically, the pattern enables robust and scalable software architectures.

By understanding and applying the Strategy Design Pattern, developers can create more modular, reusable, and adaptable codebases that can easily accommodate changes and variations in behavior.
